# Rock Paper Scissors

Redo of the previous attempts at the Odin Project

_Rock Paper Scissors_ is a two-player game: in this case the players are a
random generated choice, and the player choice.

The player is prompted with a question and can enter its choice to play a round.
This is done 5 times and in the end a counter of who won the most in the 5
rounds is the winner of the game.
